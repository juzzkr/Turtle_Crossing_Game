# Turtle Racing Game

A fun and engaging turtle racing game where players navigate a turtle through a busy road filled with cars. The objective is to reach the top of the screen while avoiding collisions with the cars!

## How to Play

1. **Movement**: Press the **"Up" key** to move the turtle forward. The turtle cannot move backwards, left, or right.
   
2. **Obstacles**: Cars are randomly generated along the y-axis and move from the right edge of the screen to the left edge.

3. **Level Up**: When the turtle reaches the top edge of the screen, it will return to its original position and the player levels up. With each new level, the speed of the cars increases, making the game more challenging!

4. **Game Over**: If the turtle collides with a car, the game is over, and all actions will stop.
